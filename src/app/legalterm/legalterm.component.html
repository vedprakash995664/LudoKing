Courts in India have determined that a game of skill is one where success depends mainly on the player’s skill, not chance. No penalty can be imposed for playing such games.</li>
                                    <li>The ‘Ludo’ game on our platform is classified as a <b>Game of Skill</b> under Indian law. We do not support or offer <b>games of chance</b> for money. Games of Skill are those where a player’s effort and skill significantly impact the outcome.</li>

                                    <li>Games may include elements of chance, but these are challenges or obstacles that users can overcome using their skills and knowledge. Elements of luck add thrill but do not dictate the game's outcome.</li>
                                    <li>Users' performance may improve with time and practice as the games are skill-based.</li>
                                    <li>Certain games may have pre-determined outcomes (e.g., Ludo), achievable through users' skills.</li>
